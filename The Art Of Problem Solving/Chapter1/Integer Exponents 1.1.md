"Mutliplication is simply a shorthand for repeated addition. For example, 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 5 × 2. Similarly, x + x + x + x = 4x.

Just as we have a shorthand for repeated addition, we have a simpler way of writing repeated multiplication. For example; 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 = 2⁵. Similarly, x ⋅ x ⋅ x ⋅ x = x⁴, the product of four x's.

Here are some basic rules about exponents:

**EXAMPLE 1-1 2⁵ ⋅ 2⁶**
The first term is the product of five 2s and the second term is the product of six 2s. So altogether, we have the product of eleven 2s. i.e  2⁵ ⋅ 2⁶ = 2¹¹ = 2048. ( Notice we have simply added the two exponents 5 and 6!)"

Now, I do gather from this example: **2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 5 × 2**, that when adding a number to itself many times, it gets messy quickly, so a more efficient way to do it would be to count how many **times** you are adding that *constant*, then multiply it by the *constant* itself. Here, we are adding 2 **five times**,, so we multiply that 5 by 2, like, 2 "**five times**", or **five times** 2, or you have 5 twos that pile up on each other, until they are the same height as 10. I will remember what I wanted to stress for sure, hahaha.

From this one: 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 = 2⁵, I gather that if you multiply a constant by itself over and over, for *n* number of times, then it is the same as just raising that constant to a power *n*.
Times is one level higher than addition in the operations hierarchy, so multiplying a number by itself over and over, just forms an exponential growth, I don't think there's enough English in my head to explain this one well,,, but yeah,,, hihihi.

In a nutshell,multiplication and raising to a power, are respectively shorter ways of counting how many times to add or multiply constants.

Discussing (EXAMPLE 1-1) 2⁵ ⋅ 2⁶
This one I think could be solved in two ways:

1) Notice that we are counting how many times to multiply two by itself, and it is 11 here. Just add the powers!. To see it clearly expand both expressions (2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2) × (2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2)
                                        = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2
   we are multiplying 2 eleven times, therefore it is 2¹¹!
   
3) Multiplication is repeated addition, so an expression like this: 2⁵ ⋅ 2⁶, says; add 2⁶ to itself 2⁵ times, just as 5 × 2 says add 2 to itself 5 times.

**NB**: **Multiplication and addition are commutative, as I have learned from my c++ studies, so saying this: 5 × 2 means "add 5 to itself 2 times is the same as saying "add 2 to itself 5 times".**

I thought what the book has not discussed is the addition of exponents with the same base. I wondered it there was a way to add 5² + 5² without finding the values of both expressions? This question was heavily motivated by this one: 2⁵ ⋅ 2⁶, multiplication of exponential expressions with the same base, that can be solved by simply adding the exponents, but what about addition of exponential expressions of the same base?

First I tried to work out 5² + 5² and quickly realised that I can simply count that I am adding 5² two times, then just multiply out like this 5² + 5² = 2(5²) = 2(25) = 50.

So I varied the exponents: 5⁵ + 5² and here is how I first attempted to solve it: 5³(5²).

Then I entered the expression in my calculator to confirm 5⁵ + 5² = 3,150 and 5³(5²) = 3,125. I noticed that the difference between the two is 25 = 5²!

so I added that to my initial solution, like this: 5³(5²) + 5².

Then I wanted to see if the same pattern would show up to other problems of the same nature, in short, I noticed this pattern: 

7⁸ + 7³ = 7⁵(7³) + 7³

8¹¹ + 8⁷ = 8⁴(8⁷) + 8⁷, and so on ...

At this moment, I felt like I had discovered new Maths! Seeing this pattern repeat like that, made me feel like I am a Math guru fr fr. hahaha...

But my grand discovery still felt off, because if the goal is to find the shorthand for performing this addition as we have the multiplication, then I did not want to have the same expression to repeat itself. For instance, 5² in 5³(5²) + 5² and 7³ in 7⁵(7³) + 7³ etc. I spend a few minutes trying to find a way to rewrite this until I gave in and went to check online if something along those lines already exists somewhere. And I learned that it is just the **Factor Theorem for Exponentials**. And if my brain wasn't so crusty, I should have easily spotted  that all I had to do was find the HCF and factor it out such that I'd have 5²(5³ + 1) for 5⁵ + 5² etc. 

After learning this, I did realize that to get from the off-ish format of my solutions, such as: 8⁴(8⁷) + 8⁷, to the correct form, I would simply have to go a step further and note that 8⁷, is common in both 8⁴(8⁷) and 8⁷. So 8⁴(8⁷) + 8⁷ => 8⁷(8⁴ + 1)! 

!!!!La ka tatela ho nahana hore ke ntj'a game shem! hahaha, I deifinitely need to take my time next time and also not be quick to run to uncle google!!!! 

Having taken this long way out to reach the end point helped a lot though, coz I feel like I will never ever forget why that theorem holds true. It's different from just reading and memorizing you know.

So, this long ass approach that i took, made me enjoy re-learning this stuff. The fulfilment that came this realization is exactly why i will be back at it tomorrow!
