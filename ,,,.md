I have been intensely struggling to find my balance since the last time i made a commit. 
Been pushing forward with Math and c++, and feeling horrible for leaving other parts of my life, mostly my creative outlets, behind. 
Today i mapped out a proper schedule by implementing time blocking. I believe will make me much more efficient in the coming days. 

I will begin implenting this schedule at 0000hrs today.

Despite all else, one little break through I made is being able to filter out important information my learning material. Writers tend to overexplain things 
because longer content is often perceived as having more value by publishers, something which makes learning tedious for folks like me who **prefer straight forward content**.
