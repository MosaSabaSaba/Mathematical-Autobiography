# Why I'm Learning Mathematics: A Journey From Web Dev to Competitive Programming

I have been out of school for a while now, spending about a year trying to learn web development, I do not know how this looks on me but after this year, it is safe to say I still do not know how to develop web applications.

So i decided to look into other programming fields.

Competitive programming in particular, caught my attention, and this is how it happened: first, I saw a YT video on Gennady, then a few days later, I saw "Collin Galen" narrating his journey on his YT channel. I decided to go check both guys out on Codeforces, then took a detour to the problemsets. Here, something incredible happened! I deciphered several easier problems completely in my head, discussed my mental models with deepseek, laying out step-by-step approaches like this: 

"I don't know how to write c++ yet, but if i did, I would write code that does A, B, C, and D to solve 'that' problem."

Guess what? **All of my logical solutions were spot on!**

Right then, I committed to CP, **blasted Whatever It Takes by Imagine Dragons** on my laptop as I too, created my account on Codeforces (MosaSabaSaba).
Now, I am not delusional - I know there will be ups, downs, as well as plateaus along the way, but being able to solve those rudimentary problems logically was the sign I needed.
I did a lot of research and the impression I got is that; CP is Math applications, so alongside learning C++, I will need to refresh my Math, and learn a lot more. "The Art Of Problem Solving" feels like the right place to start.

I am documenting my journey here. I have no idea where this will take me, but I sure will need some thing to look back to at this time next year!!!!


I DO NOT KNOW WHERE I AM GOING, BUT I'M GOING THERE WITH EVERYTHING I'VE GOT. I AM READY FOR WHATEVER IT TAKES.
